	<p style="color:#FFA700; font-weight:Extra-Bold; font-size:xx-large" > HBUS is a set of specifications </p>
	<p>aiming to provide a solution for accessible and low cost home automation.

	It includes a hardware bus specification, a communications protocol and other utilities.</p>

	<p>HBUS is a master-slave system, where the devices are slaves connected to a common bus and are controlled by one single master with a fixed bus address.</p>

	<p style="color:#FFA700; font-weight:Extra-Bold; font-size:xx-large">The system is flexible and keeps low-cost in mind.</p>
	<p> The specifications aim to provide for a lot of functionality such as secure communication between master and devices and also identity verification.</p>
	<p>It also provides user with a local automation paradigm that enables the user to program a device for localized automations that do not need master intervention and can still continue to operate in case of master failure.</p>

	<p>HBUS is open-source and code and specifications are being restructured and made available gradually.</p>
